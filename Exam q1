1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Technology that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.

Public class Smartphone extends Technology{
 Public int number;
 Public Smartphone(int number){
  Super(name);
  This.number=number
}
}

b)  Explain what POLYMORPHISM is.

polymorphism allows us to reference a diferent part of code in a different file. because a long code takes a long time 
to compile and sometomes we don't really want to compile all the code together, in this case, we can use polymorphism 
to reference diferent code together and edit codes seperately in stead of viewing them as a whole.

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  

Public void Speak(){
  System.out.println("my name is " + name + "and my number is " + number);}

d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
Inheritance
